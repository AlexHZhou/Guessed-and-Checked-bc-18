Team 'Guessed and Checked' Entry for Battlecode 2018. And when I say team, I mean me, Alex Zhou. 

Very imperfect implmenetation. Eliminted somewhere in the top 200 of 1000 teams.
Known issues:
Miners get sidetracked by impossible caches,
Rocket unit loading priorities need to be adjusted,
Units on Mars need to be much more aggressive (change combat micro to run w/o waypoints)
Estimated enemy start point needs to adjusted if initial estimate is wrong.
I need sleep.
