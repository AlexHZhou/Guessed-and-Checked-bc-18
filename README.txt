Team 'Guessed and Checked' Entry for Battlecode 2018. And when I say team, I mean me, Alex Zhou. 

Very imperfect implmenetation. Eliminted somewhere in the top 200 of 1000 teams.
Known issues:
-Miners get sidetracked by impossible caches,
-Rocket unit loading priorities need to be adjusted,
-Units on Mars need to be much more aggressive (change combat micro to run w/o waypoints)
-Estimated enemy start point needs to adjusted if initial estimate is wrong.
-Disgusting code style. Had to code fast, because not enough people (1) for that much code (1000's) in 1 month (time limit of Battlecode).
-I need sleep.
